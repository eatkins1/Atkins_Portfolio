My name's Taylor Atkins and I'm recent graduate from the George Washington University. While attending I studied in a variety of disciplines due to having a major in American Studies, which functions as a blend of anthropology and history, as well as two minors in Journalism and Computer Science. I was born and raised in Chatham, New Jersey which is also where I attended all of my pre-university schooling. I would love to put my journalism skills to use covering and reporting on any number of topics, but I'm particularly fond of covering queer and disability issues as those are both important to me. This webpage is being developed in R for the sake of a Data Journalism class at GW.
